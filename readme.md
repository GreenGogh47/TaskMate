# Learning Project Specification: TaskMate
## A Personal Task Management Mobile Application

### Project Overview
TaskMate is a personal productivity mobile application that allows users to create, organize, and track their daily tasks and goals. This project is specifically designed to provide developers with hands-on experience across the Expo/React Native/Firebase technology stack while building a complete, functional application.

### Learning Objectives
By completing this project, developers will gain practical experience with:
- React Native component architecture and navigation
- Expo development workflow and deployment
- Firebase Authentication, Firestore database operations, and real-time updates
- State management patterns
- Mobile UI/UX design principles
- Testing and debugging mobile applications

### Core Features

#### Phase 1: Foundation
**User Authentication**
- Email/password registration and login
- Password reset functionality
- User profile creation with basic information (name, profile picture)

**Basic Task Management**
- Create new tasks with title and description
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- Delete tasks
- View all tasks in a simple list

#### Phase 2: Enhancement
**Advanced Task Features**
- Set due dates and times for tasks
- Add priority levels (High, Medium, Low)
- Categorize tasks with custom tags/categories
- Add notes and attachments to tasks

**Organization & Filtering**
- Filter tasks by status (completed, pending, overdue)
- Sort tasks by due date, priority, or creation date
- Search functionality across task titles and descriptions

#### Phase 3: Polish
**User Experience**
- Push notifications for upcoming due dates
- Dark mode support
- Offline functionality with sync when online
- Task statistics and progress tracking

**Social Features**
- Share tasks with other users
- Task collaboration (optional advanced feature)

### Technical Requirements

#### Frontend (React Native/Expo)
- Use Expo CLI for project initialization with expo-router for navigation
- Utilize Expo Image for optimized image handling
- Use Expo Assets for asset management
- Leverage Expo Vector Icons for consistent iconography
- Implement Expo StatusBar for status bar management
- Use Expo LinearGradient for enhanced UI effects
- Handle loading states and error boundaries
- Use Expo Splash Screen for app launch experience

#### Backend (Firebase)
- Firebase Authentication for user management
- Firestore database for task storage
- Firebase Cloud Functions for server-side logic (advanced)
- Firebase Storage for file attachments
- Real-time database listeners for live updates

#### Data Structure
```javascript
users: {
  userId: {
    email: string,
    displayName: string,
    profilePicture: string,
    createdAt: timestamp
  }
}

tasks: {
  taskId: {
    userId: string,
    title: string,
    description: string,
    dueDate: timestamp,
    priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low',
    category: string,
    isCompleted: boolean,
    createdAt: timestamp,
    updatedAt: timestamp
  }
}
```
